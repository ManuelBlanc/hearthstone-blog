## How to install locally

TODO: Write this up!


## Note

Using `git` as a deployment tool is totally _nuts_.
Unfortunately we don't have much choice when using GH as hosting.

## Project structure

* `_cards_gen.py` generates `cards_data.json` from http://hearthstonejson.com.
* `card_tooltips.js` registers a showdown extension for the tooltips.
* `main.js` contains the logic for serving wiki pages.
